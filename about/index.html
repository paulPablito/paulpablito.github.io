<h3 id="hello-my-name-is-paul">Hello, my name is Paul.</h3>

<p>Paul the sloth, to be exact. I enjoy writing fiction.
Mostly with themes of fantasy, focused on self-discovery. Though I can
be slow at times, at producing my works - I am a sloth after all -
I try to present to you only my best stories.</p>

<p>One of these stories concern the life of Tom Turley.
We first meet him as a young boy, living together with his mother
in a port town. His father rarely visits, as his profession does not
allow it. He is a sailor who spends many months of the year
at sea.</p>

<p>This first part of Tom&rsquo;s life, I will try to tell you in the form
of diary entries. Page by page, you will get to know this boy.
You will learn of his trials and tribulatians, of the sacrificies
he must bring and the losses he will suffer.</p>

<p>After the diary has pages no more, the story will truely begin.
Tom Turley, will be revealed to you, in all his facets.</p>
