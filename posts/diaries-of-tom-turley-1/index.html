        <p>Mother was crying again. She tried to be quiet, but I heard. I will never get used to the sound. Why must she always be sad? Didn’t she wed father for love? I wonder if they had it better before me.</p>

<p>Father came to see me goodnight. He sat on my bedside, telling me one of his stories. His gaze often left my face. I could see in his eyes, that he was dreaming of the sea. I asked him if he would leave again, but he didn’t answer.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I will help in Thompson’s again. It’s dirty, but it pays. Even if father is home now, he will surely leave soon. We need the money, then. Mother can’t work with her sickness.</p>

<p>Maybe I should leave it all. Become a seafaring man, like father. But mother will be all alone. And even though I want to be free like my father, I don’t want to be him.</p>
